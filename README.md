# Fake Call

The fake calls application helps you to receive calls on your phone for real, as the application allows you to make instant calls, that is, receive incoming calls at the moment, and there is also the feature of setting scheduled calls by setting times to receive fake calls.
The application uses:
- The incoming call uses the original ringtone.
- The original application to import the call (as if there was a real call).
There are still additional functions under development.
